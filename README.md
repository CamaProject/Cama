#College Admissions Mentors For Africa

This is a [website](https://github.com/luwangac/CAMAProject) hosted on github using gh-pages. Most of the layout borrows from the Bootstrap [Agency](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/agency/) theme,  a one page agency portfolio theme for [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) created by [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/). 

Domain of the website is [camaafrica.org] (http://camaafrica.org) but it's also viewable at [https://github.com/CAMAProject/CAMAProject] (https://github.com/CAMAProject/CAMAProject)
