                        <p class="text-muted" align="justify">Cynthia Mulindi is a junior student at New York University Abu Dhabi, where she is majoring in Economics with a concentration in Finance and Psychology. Cynthia has taken diverse courses in disciplines such as theatre, music, business and marketing. While studying at NYUAD, she has been involved in the Abu Dhabi community by volunteering at The Future Center for Special Needs, the Filipino Safe House and the Women’s Labor Camp. She believes that the key to eradication of poverty is education, as a good education allows people to acquire the skills they need in order to develop. Thus, being part of CAMA and working with a very passionate team is a chance for her to share her experience and help others attain such an education. In 2015, she interned with the education department at the Rwandan embassy in Washington DC, where she acted as a liaison between the department and Rwandan students in the US. She initiated a program that will help collect the student’s contacts and locations, to ensure that the embassy is able to more easily support them during their study abroad. Cynthia is also interested in learning more about mental health, particularly how culture-specific coping mechanisms may create resiliency and their impact on the recovery time from traumatic events such as war and genocide.

				She believes that education is a force that can empower and produce long-lasting change. 
				She has worked in a broad range of settings that have affirmed this belief; from a volunteer pre-school teacher in the Philippines to a facilitator in a Leadership Development Series for young girls in Abu Dhabi. 
				In these experiences, she enjoyed being able to help others develop the tools they need to cultivate their own dreams and aspirations. 
				She recognizes that her passion to be involved in education was fostered by the wonderful mentors she had as a teenager which is why CAMA is a personal project for her and a way in which she can give back to other African students who may be facing barriers in their academic trajectory. In her free time, Vongai enjoys composing poetry and short stories, running and having a good debate about almost anything.</p>
